# moving-a-plane-through-arrow-keys-and-sound-toggle-project
this is a beginner web development project i have created using css web development and javascript.
It is a simple project which demonstrates how we can use event listeners to interact with various elements of our website


Things I learned during this project:

1)how to toggle event listeners which are triggered when we press certain keys

2)Due to new policy in google chrome,it does not allow websites to directly play audio,as soon as the user has entered.User has to do some kind 
  of interaction and should have the option to pause it.
  
3)How to include svg icons.
